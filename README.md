# codebase-to-learn-from

Collection of public repos that 
a) illustrate end-to-end dev process or 
b) illustrate a tech(concept/library/framework) seperately in a superior way with a well chosen format/example.  

> "A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books." - Paul Graham

I think for software, we have to find good quality code as well that is written/architected properly so that it can enhance our understanding and benefit us. And, we can build open on top of that just like we can build ideas from the good books we read. 

So here is some code that I have found.
